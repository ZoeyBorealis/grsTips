Shopping list for anyone getting a vagina installed. Buy the following:

- Surgilube. Seriously. You cannot buy too much of that stuff. SURGILUBE. BUY AS MUCH AS YOU CAN AFFORD. THIS IS PRIORITY NUMBER ONE. (You MIGHT be able to get this covered by insurance. I did by having my primary doctor write a prescription for Surgilube that I took to Central Supply at the hospital. They just gave me the Surgilube that their doctors usually use in surgery)

- This cushion, for sitting on in your first month or two, when you're still too swollen to comfortably sit as you used to: https://www.contourliving.com/kabooti-donut-coccyx-cushion/ I STRONGLY recommend getting the version with the freezable insert. It feels HEAVENLY to sit on an ice-cold pad with your poor, swollen vulva. 

- Puppy training pads. You sleep on these for the first few months, when you still have discharge and need to air it out. You also dilate while lying on a puppy pad, to catch any lube (and initially, blood) that dribbles downward. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EI673B6

- A burn cradle. You can get one on eBay, or possibly through your doctor. It's a collapsible metal cage-like thing that you use to hold your bedsheets aloft above your vulva while you sleep. This way, you can sleep with the covers, while still airing out the surgery site. 

- Dental bibs. Buy LOTS of these. Your dilators go on these when you remove them, because if you use paper towels, the various fluids and gels can and will seep through onto the surface underneath. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0025TWH8C

- Douching supplies. Varies by surgeon. Brassard has us use sterile saline for the first two months, and this is far easier if you just buy huge boxes of sterile saline from a medical supply source than if you make it yourself (http://www.vitalitymedical.com/mckesson-usp-normal-saline-irrigation-solution.html). I went through about 11 fl oz of saline per douche, which is 22 fl oz per day during the first two months. I also recommend buying your own douche, since the one they provide is flimsy and small. I like this one: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I018CV4

- Ultra-rich body cream, if you're required to take sitz baths. (Your feet, legs, and hands are going to be drier than you would believe from all that soapy water.)

- PAPER TOWELS. SO MANY PAPER TOWELS. Preferably the kind cut into smaller pieces. 

- Dish soap. LOTTTTTTTS of dish soap. This is for washing your dilators and douche. 

- Disinfecting bathroom spray. You will want to clean up the gunk that comes out of you in the shower/tub in the first month. 

- Adult diapers. Humiliating, I know, but pads alone will NOT be enough to catch all the discharge coming out of you in your first few weeks. 

- Pads, for when the discharge goes down enough that the diapers are excessive. 

- Liners, for when the pads become excessive. (This one's optional, but I personally don't even like how big pads feel.)

- Sensitive skin cleanser gel, for washing your vulva. (I know they say bar soap works fine, but I like to be extra cautious. It's new!)

- A hand mirror that you like. Make sure it's big, and has a convenient handle. You will use this multiple times a day, every day, for the first six months. (Your phone's selfie camera will work in a pinch, but it's not as good.)

- LOTS of unscented liquid hand soap, if you're required to take sitz baths. 

- Baby wipes. LOTS of baby wipes. Carry a pack everywhere you go, too. You'll thank me later. 

- A small but powerful electric fan, for speeding up how quickly your vulva air dries after showers/baths. (You'll get excess fibrin if you don't dry it enough.)

- Several very comfortable pairs of sweatpants with pockets. (Tight clothes are uncomfortable when you're still swollen down there.)

- A damn good razor. Dilating and massaging your scars will be significantly easier if you keep your pubic hair to a minimum. 

- TV trays, so you can eat your meals on the couch, where the generous padding minimizes pressure on your surgical site. (This is crucial.)

- Protein powder. You should have at least one protein shake per day to speed up healing. 

- Creatine, omega-3, and multivitamin supplements. All clinically shown to accelerate healing from major surgery. 

- Your favorite fruits and vegetables. Eat these as often as you can. You MUST have a healthy diet early on to avoid complications. 

- Probiotic yogurt, for two reasons: To help you recover from all the antibiotics you will have to take, and to establish a healthy bacterial flora in your new vagina.  

- LOTS of ibuprofen and acetaminophen. Ibuprofen helps swelling, but it's bad for your stomach, so take acetaminophen instead when you can tolerate the swelling. (Oh and never take ibuprofen without food or milk, or else you risk a stomach ulcer)

- Optional: SkinMedica Scar Recovery Gel. This stuff works wonders for making your post-op vulva scarring as invisible as possible. It's expensive, though. You can buy it at skin clinics. https://www.skinmedica.com/howtopurchase Apply once the incisions are closed. 

- Diaper cream. Apply this to your external scars once they've closed. Aside from protecting the skin, the zinc in diaper cream also nourishes your healing tissues, and it reduces inflammation. This stuff is cheap and effective. It comes recommended from a wound care professional. 

[I'm using both SkinMedica Scar Recovery Gel and diaper cream. First I cleanse the vulva with Cetaphil's sensitive skin cleanser, then I massage my scars with SkinMedica Scar Recovery gel, and I finish with a thin layer of diaper cream.]

- Nitrile exam gloves, if you don't like getting these gels and ointments on your fingers when applying them. (Also useful for poking around down south if you need to examine yourself.)

- Some quality condoms and/or dental dams, for when you're >3 months post-op, and decide to take her out for a spin. (The last thing a new vagina needs is an STD!) I recommend these: http://lovabilitycondoms.com/

- A good speaker system for your bedroom. Seriously. You're going to be spending so much time in there dilating that you're gonna want something nice to listen to.
